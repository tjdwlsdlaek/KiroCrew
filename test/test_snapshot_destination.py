"""Tests for the off-host destination: provisioned once, then written to.

The design under test replaced one where every backup run tried to decide, from inside
the write path, whether an arbitrary bucket was safe. These assert the two properties
that make that unnecessary:

1. A backup writes ONLY to a destination `setup` created and recorded — it cannot be
   pointed at a bucket by a caller, and it refuses when setup has not run.
2. Every object write carries `--expected-bucket-owner`, so S3 refuses the write if the
   bucket is no longer ours rather than this code trying to prove it is.
