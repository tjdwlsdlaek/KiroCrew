"""Issue Radar — dispatch readiness (RFC phase 0).

Issue Radar reads everything through the user's own provider CLI and needs no
local clone. Asking an agent to *implement* an issue does need one, so a
connected repo carries an optional local checkout path and dispatch is gated on
it.

This module owns two things and no I/O beyond stat:

* :func:`resolve_checkout` — validate a user-supplied path, or refuse it.
* :func:`readiness` — turn a stored path into a ready flag plus a reason a UI
  can render without re-deriving the rule.

Nothing here runs an agent or touches git. The gate exists first, on its own, so
that the phase which does run an agent has no judgement left to make.

    The rules, in order, each of which has a reason:

    * ``~`` expanded and symlinks resolved BEFORE the sensitivity test, so a
      symlink planted in a benign directory cannot smuggle its target past it.
    * A value the OS cannot resolve at all (an embedded NUL, plus the
      platform-specific shapes that raise ``OSError``) is refused rather than
      raised. Every other unusable value returns ``None`` here, and a caller made
      to catch one exception separately will eventually forget.
    * Must be absolute, asserted on the EXPANDED INPUT and before ``realpath``.
      ``realpath`` resolves a relative value against the gateway's own cwd and
      always returns an absolute path, so testing afterwards can never fail and
      the guarantee would be vacuous.
    * Must not be a sensitive path (credential stores, ``.ssh``, ``.aws``, the
      governance policy files) per :func:`kiro_crew.security.is_sensitive_path`.
    * Must be an existing directory holding a ``.git`` entry. ``.git`` may be a
      directory (an ordinary clone) or a FILE (a linked worktree's ``gitdir:``
      pointer), so both are accepted; a bare repository has neither and is
      refused, which is correct — it has no work tree to edit.
