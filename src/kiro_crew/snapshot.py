    THE chokepoint for component tree roots. Three separate sites touch them — the
    staging walk, the replace pass and the merge pass — and each was found to
    dereference a link independently, so the check lives here once.

    Two INDEPENDENT properties are required, and neither implies the other:

    **Containment** — the fully resolved path is a strict descendant of the resolved
    home. This answers "can a read or write through this root land outside the
    directory we are allowed to touch". Checking whether the node itself is a link
    does not answer it: a link nested under the root, or an ancestor of it, escapes
    while every individual node looks ordinary. ``Path.resolve()`` follows every link
    in the path, so the comparison covers roots, ancestors, descendants and Windows
    junctions at once. Equality with the home is refused, not allowed: a link like
    ``workspace/memory -> ..`` resolves to the home itself, which would make the
    "component tree" the whole home and sweep ``.env`` and ``sel_hmac.key`` into an
    archive meant to carry memory. No declared component tree is ever the home.

    **Identity** — no path segment from the home down to the root is a link. This
    answers a different question: "is this the tree the component declared". A link
    that redirects to another subtree INSIDE the home satisfies containment perfectly
    — ``workspace/memory -> ../apps`` resolves to a strict descendant — while
    silently changing WHICH data is archived. Because these bundles are uploaded, a
    redirect is an exfiltration primitive, not a mix-up: the archive would carry
    whatever the link points at under the name of the component that was asked for.
    Containment cannot see this, because nothing left the home.

    The recovery half of replace-mode atomicity. Everything the replace pass changes is
    saved under *backup* BEFORE the first mutation, so undoing the whole set returns the
    data home to one coherent generation regardless of how far the pass got. Recovering
    only the item that failed is what leaves memory half-old and half-new.

    **Granularity is the invariant, and it is exactly *targets*.** Every entry is a
    declared relative path, and recovery touches nothing else. Walking the rollback
    DIRECTORY instead looks equivalent and is not: memory's trees are nested
    (``workspace/memory``), so ``backup`` contains a partial ``workspace/`` holding only
    those subtrees. Treating that directory as one unit clears the live ``workspace``
    whole and puts the partial copy back — deleting unrelated workspace data the restore
    never touched. Restoring `workspace/memory` restores `workspace/memory`.

    Two cases per target, and both are needed:

    * **Saved** — put it back, clearing only that path.
    * **Not saved** — the target did not exist before the restore, so the copy the
      restore created is REMOVED. That is what "no pre-restore state" restores to;
      leaving it standing keeps half the incoming generation.

    Best-effort per target, and it says so per target: a recovery that aborts on its
    first problem strands the rest, and by this point the operator's own data is what is
    at stake. Whatever cannot be undone is named, and this function never deletes the
