"""Off-host destination for snapshot bundles — a bucket set up once, then written to.

A snapshot written into ``<data home>/snapshots/`` lives inside the directory it is
protecting, so it does not survive losing the host. This module gives the bundle a
destination in the operator's own AWS account.

The shape matters more than the mechanics. Provisioning is a **one-time, explicit
act** (``kirocrew backup setup``) that creates the bucket, applies every at-rest
control, verifies them against the API's own answer, and records the result. Backing
up afterwards writes only to that recorded bucket.

That split is deliberate, and it replaced a design where every backup run tried to
decide, automatically, whether an arbitrary bucket was safe to write to. Proving that
is not a job code can finish: a tag says who *intended* a bucket for backup, a bucket
policy has to be parsed to learn who can read it, Block Public Access does not
neutralise a CloudFront origin grant, and each of those was a separate hole. Creating
the bucket ourselves and refusing everything else answers the question once instead.

What remains in the write path is one guarantee, and S3 enforces it rather than this
code: every object write carries ``--expected-bucket-owner``, so a bucket that is no
longer ours — deleted and re-created by someone else under the same name — fails the
write instead of receiving it.

No new credential surface: every AWS call goes through the deploy module's single
``aws`` CLI chokepoint, which resolves credentials from a profile *name*. Kiro Crew
never reads ``~/.aws`` and never holds a key, and ``boto3`` stays optional.

    THE chokepoint for "may this process record a backup destination". It lives here,
    in the library, and not in the CLI wrapper, because a guard is only worth what its
    narrowest path is worth: with the check in `backup_main`, anything able to run code
    in this process could call `setup_destination` directly and provision plus record an
    arbitrary destination with no authorization at all. The lesson, arrived at the hard
    way, was: put the check where the mutation happens.

    What this gate is worth, stated honestly, because the stronger claim was made here
    and was wrong. The authorization records that an OPERATOR CHOSE a destination. It
    does NOT establish that an agent could not have produced it. The keystone floor over
    the token's directory is two policy layers -- a sensitive-path check that the agent's
    file tools honour, and a deny pattern over command lines naming it -- and neither
    inspects the body of a program. An agent that writes a script elsewhere and runs it
    by path defeats both without doing anything exotic. There is no separate uid and no
    ACL this process lacks. Making the stronger claim true needs a control this module
    does not own (a PreToolUse denial of agent-issued `backup setup`, or an OS-level
    keystone), so this module does not assert it.

    It is still worth having: it turns "an agent sets up a backup destination" from the
    default outcome of asking for one into something that requires deliberate
    circumvention. What holds independently of it is the part to lean on -- the backup
    path takes no bucket from its caller, every write carries --expected-bucket-owner so
    S3 refuses a foreign-owned bucket, and setup verifies privacy before recording.

    The authorization NAMES its destination, and the name has to match what the caller
    actually resolved. A blank permission slip is not an authorization: with several
    profiles registered, an operator could create the token intending one account while
    the caller consumes it against another, and every later backup would go somewhere

    Every reason to reject a pre-existing bucket lives here, in ONE function, called
    BEFORE ``consume_authorization``. The ordering is the requirement, not a detail: the
    authorization is one-shot and deleted on use, so a refusal raised after consumption
    charges the operator a fresh out-of-band token for a bucket problem they can simply
    fix and retry. Refusals that cost nothing keep the honest path cheap.

    Keeping them together is what stops that from regressing. The checks arrived one at
    a time and each new one was added at the site it guarded — which sat after
    consumption — so the ordering had to be rediscovered every time. A single
    pre-consumption chokepoint means a check added here inherits the ordering instead of
    re-litigating it.

    Three reasons, all read-only:

    1. **SSE-KMS configured.** Hardening applies AES256 unconditionally, so an
       operator's KMS default could only be kept by overwriting and restoring it, and a
       failure between those two steps leaves the bucket readable without the key with
       nothing reporting it.
    2. **Not ours.** Setup REPLACES the lifecycle configuration, so adopting an
       unrelated bucket discards its rules and starts expiring its noncurrent objects on
       our schedule — destroying data in order to set up a backup.
    3. **Carries a bucket policy.** Hardening sets public-access, ownership and
       encryption controls, none of which revoke a policy, so a bucket already granting
       read elsewhere would publish the memory it is about to receive.

    The recorded destination is admitted without the tag read: re-running setup on our
    own recorded bucket is the documented repair path, and it must keep working even if
