"""`kirocrew backup` — provision the off-host destination once, then inspect it.

Provisioning is deliberately its own command rather than something a backup run does
implicitly. Creating the bucket ourselves, recording it, and refusing every other bucket
answers "is this safe to write my memory into" once, visibly, with a human present —
instead of asking a backup job to re-derive that answer automatically on every run.

`kirocrew snapshot --components memory --to-s3` is the thing you schedule; it writes only
to what `setup` recorded.

    An earlier revision gated this on ``sys.stdin.isatty()`` and described it as a
    human-presence check. It is not one: a pty is a thing any process can allocate, so
    `printf 'yes\\n' | script -qec 'kirocrew backup setup ...' /dev/null` satisfies both
    the isatty test and the prompt. That was demonstrated in practice, not hypothesised
    -- the recording made to showcase the guard drove it exactly that way.

    A terminal cannot carry authorization because the property being tested has to be
    something the caller is unable to produce. What it *can* be is the same primitive
    this codebase already uses when an agent must not be able to enable something: a
    file under a keystone path. ``<data home>/backup/`` is classified sensitive, so both
    the agent's file tools and any shell command naming that path are refused. A token
    inside it is therefore writable by the operator and by nothing the agent can drive,
    which is exactly the asymmetry a confirmation needs.

    So: the operator creates the token once, out of band; setup consumes it and deletes
    it, so a single authorization cannot be replayed into a second redirection later.
    The prompt is kept as well -- it is genuinely useful for catching the wrong profile
    -- but it is no longer load-bearing for security, and the docstring says so rather
    than leaving the next reader to assume otherwise.
